OPEN

All the going is not recorded in the database for some reason

=====================================================

ANDHIEKA
you should be notified when there is a message that is not pushed yet to you
"Jio me" must be saved after login. (Must save pending jio, just like pending marker)
Double/triple/quadruple counting of hungry people (via socket only)
After press I'm going, not appended to going list
Cross-Site Scripting (javascript inside chat). reflected xss.


KANG SOON
Discuss: Hungry people count is not useful to the general user. It is covering the map.

differentiate markers that you join + filtering  (by join and by time)

Jio-ed button should be disabled. (I am going > jieod cant be clicked > close > open > jioed can be clicked again

Last selected chat box should have the highest z-index



CHOON HIAN 
chat box can be smaller

Combine hours and minutes: 24 hour format preferable? (Use . as separator preferable?)
auto-infer meal type from time

Time and location (description) must be shown inside the chat.
